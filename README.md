# 🏏 **IPL Cricket Squad Selection**  

---

## 📌 **Overview**  
Selecting the right squad is crucial for success in the **Indian Premier League (IPL)**.  

This project leverages **data analytics and machine learning** to optimize team selection based on:  
- **Player performance**  
- **Match conditions**  
- **Strategic balance**  

The goal is to build a **data-driven approach** that enhances squad selection decisions and improves match-winning probabilities.

## 🎯 **Key Features**  

👉 **Data-Driven Squad Selection** – Analyze player stats, past performances, and match conditions.  

👉 **AI-Powered Predictions** – Use ML models (**XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM**) to predict player performance.  

👉 **Balanced Team Composition** – Ensure a well-structured team with the right mix of **batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders**.   

👉 **Real-Time Updates** – Integrate real-time **player form, injuries, and tournament dynamics**.

## 🔍 **How It Works**  

1️⃣ **Data Collection** – Gather historical and live match data (**player stats, pitch conditions, match outcomes**).  

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Extract meaningful features (**batting/bowling averages, strike rates, economy rates, etc.**).  

3️⃣ **Model Training** – Train ML models (**XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN**) for performance predictions.  

4️⃣ **Squad Optimization** – Rank and recommend the **best squad** based on data-driven insights.  

5️⃣ **Final Selection** – Adjust squad dynamically using **real-time updates and expert recommendations**.
